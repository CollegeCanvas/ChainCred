# ChainCred

**ChainCred** is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform built on blockchain technology. It allows users to lend and borrow directly, without the need for traditional intermediaries, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency through smart contracts.

## Features

- **Decentralized Lending**: Directly connect lenders and borrowers using smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions.
- **Blockchain-Powered Security**: All transactions are secured on the blockchain, providing transparency, immutability, and trust in every loan agreement.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Loan agreements, disbursements, and repayments are automatically enforced through smart contracts, reducing manual processes and human error.

- **Global Access**: Accessible to anyone with an internet connection, breaking down geographical barriers in lending.
